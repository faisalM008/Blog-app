## Overview
This is a demo blog app made with Ruby on Rails. It allows you to create/edit/delete a post as well as to comment on these posts. You can also set the visibility of your comment as public/private/archived. I have used bootstrap to further enhance the user experience while using this web app. 

## Schema
The post and comment have 1 to many active record association meaning 1 post can have many comments. In future I plan to incorporate advanced concepts such as polymorphic associations in this web app.<br>

Once you click on the "Create Post" button, your blog will be assigned a dedicated page where both you and your readers can view your post. This page also provides a comment section, where people can leave their feedback and engage in a discussion with you and other readers.

### Comments
You and your readers have the ability to add comments to your blog, which will appear below the post on its dedicated page.
